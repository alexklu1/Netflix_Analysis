## Netflix Sales Project with Excel and Power BI

In this Netflix sales analysis, I harnessed the power of Excel and Power BI to extract meaningful insights from Netflix's monthly sales data. By meticulously cleaning the data and crafting compelling visualisations, the project aimed to illuminate strategic avenues for growth. Key questions were explored to pinpoint areas of focus:

### Project Objectives:

Subscription Intelligence: Unveiling both subscriber counts and revenue streams, the analysis identified the subscription plan that commands the largest user base while driving substantial revenue. This knowledge lays the groundwork for targeted expansion efforts.

Gender-Driven Revenue: With a spotlight on gender-based revenue distribution, the project dissected the preferred plans of the gender contributing most significantly to revenue. This information aids in tailoring offerings to maximise engagement and financial impact.

Global Footprint and Age Dynamics: By highlighting the nation propelling the highest consumption and revenue, alongside the age group dominating subscriptions and financial contribution, the project provides crucial insights for strategic decision-making.
